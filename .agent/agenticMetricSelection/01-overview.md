Adding an **agentic evaluation metric selection** feature to your RAG evaluation API is a great idea! It aligns with the trend toward more intuitive, user-friendly interfaces in AI/ML tooling. Here’s why it’s valuable and some considerations:

### **Pros of Your Idea:**

1. **Lower Barrier to Entry**

   - Many users (especially non-experts) may not know which metrics (e.g., `NDCG@k`, `BERTScore`, `Faithfulness`, `Answer Relevance`) are best for their use case.
   - Natural language queries (e.g., _"I care about factual accuracy over speed"_) make the API more accessible.

2. **Dynamic Metric Selection**

   - An agent could consider:
     - The **domain** (e.g., legal vs. casual chat).
     - **User priorities** (e.g., latency, correctness, diversity).
     - **RAG component** (retriever vs. generator evaluation).

3. **Competitive Advantage**
   - Most RAG eval tools (like `Ragas`, `TruLens`, `LlamaIndex Evals`) require manual metric selection. An AI-powered recommender would stand out.

### **Key Considerations:**

1. **How the Agent Works**

   - **Rule-based**: Simple keyword matching (e.g., "factual" → `Faithfulness`, "diverse" → `Diversity@k`).
   - **LLM-based**: Use a small classifier or fine-tuned LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, or Mixtral) to interpret queries and suggest metrics.

2. **Explainability**

   - The agent should **justify its choices** (e.g., _"You mentioned 'factual consistency,' so I recommend 'Faithfulness' and 'Answer Correctness' metrics."_).

3. **Fallback Mechanism**

   - If the agent is uncertain, it should default to a **safe, general-purpose metric set** (e.g., `Answer Relevance` + `Retrieval Precision`).

4. **Integration with Existing Workflow**
   - Ensure the selected metrics can be **seamlessly passed** to your existing evaluation pipeline.

### **Example Implementation**

```python
def recommend_metrics(user_query: str) -> List[str]:
    system_prompt = """
    You are a RAG evaluation expert. Recommend metrics based on the user's needs.
    User Query: {query}
    Think step-by-step and return a JSON with "metrics" and "reasoning".
    """
    response = llm(system_prompt.format(query=user_query))
    return response["metrics"]
```

### **Potential Challenges**

- **Ambiguity in Queries**: Users might say vague things like _"I want good answers."_
- **Metric Overload**: Avoid recommending too many metrics, which could slow down evaluation.
- **Bias in Suggestions**: The agent might favor certain metrics based on training data.

### **Next Steps**

1. Start with a **simple rule-based version** (e.g., keyword → metric mapping).
2. Later, upgrade to an **LLM-powered agent** for nuanced understanding.
3. Collect user feedback to refine recommendations.
